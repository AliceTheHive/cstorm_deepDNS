# deepDNS
cryptostorm's DNSchain'd, DNScurve'd, native .onion + .bit + .i2p domain resolver magicks
public-facing stuff collated here in this repository (which is available directly via <a href="http://deepdns.dk">deepdns.dk</a>) and in the <a href="http://deepdns.net">deepdns.net</a> subforum of cryptostorms <a href="https://cryptostorm.org">member forum</a>, collectively. Or, jump to the primary deepDNS forum thread <a href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=8553">here</a>, if you prefer.


NEW: we've mirrored over the current listing of all deepDNS resolvers available for public use. These are collected together under the HAF-style balancers via:

<b>public.deepdns.net</b>
<b>public.deepdns.dk</b>

We used to call these <i>cryptostorm-shared.deepdns.net/dk</i> but that's so cumbersome since everyone always referred to them as "the public deepDNS resolvers" anyway; to avoid dual maintenance overhead in the future, we've rm'd all the cryptostorm-shared A Records entirely, so folks who used those will need to switch to public.deepdns.net/dk once and from then on it's all smooth sailing :-)

Also, we never actually got around to announcing the public availability of these deepDNS resolvers... which is sort of sad, because they're quite handy. We should really do that...


ps: if anyone wants to help with project management on deepDNS, please don't hesitate to let us know - we'd love to have more hands on the till, as it were, to help make the service more broadly available!
